# GitKraken Themes

The themes I like to use on GitKraken (I'm currently using 1984).

## Sources

* [1984](https://github.com/JonBunator/gitkraken-custom-themes/blob/master/Themes/1984/1984-dark.jsonc) - Cyberpunk theme (very cool)
* [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/JonBunator/gitkraken-custom-themes/tree/master/Themes/TokyoNight) - Tokyo Night theme (very drift, awesome)
* [TheMatrix](https://github.com/OwainWilliams/GitKrakenThemes/tree/master/TheMatrix) - Matrix theme (very green and much cool)

## Builder

If you're looking for a cool project, cptcrunchy is working on a builder for GitKraken themes.
