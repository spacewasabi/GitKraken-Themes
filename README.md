# GitKraken Themes

![GitKraken Logo](/images/kraken_logo.png)

The themes I like to use on GitKraken (I'm currently using 1984).

## How to change themes

Here's the [GitKraken Client Documentation](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/themes/) for changing themes on GitKraken.

## Sources

Here's a list of GitKraken themes you can use :

* [1984](https://github.com/JonBunator/gitkraken-custom-themes/blob/master/Themes/1984/1984-dark.jsonc) - Cyberpunk theme (very cool)
* [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/JonBunator/gitkraken-custom-themes/tree/master/Themes/TokyoNight) - Tokyo Night theme (very drift, awesome)
* [TheMatrix](https://github.com/OwainWilliams/GitKrakenThemes/tree/master/TheMatrix) - Matrix theme (very green and much cool)
* [Monochrome](https://github.com/JonBunator/gitkraken-custom-themes/tree/master/Themes/Monochrome) - Monochrome Dark theme (very monochrome, much dark)
* [Covered By Roses](https://github.com/chirpycora/covered-by-roses) - Crimson Dark theme (very very red, much crimson, such devil)

If you want more custom themes to check out, I recommend looking up [this page from Jonbunator](https://jonbunator.github.io/gitkraken-custom-themes/) currating multiple themes.

## Builder

If you're looking for a cool project, cptcrunchy is working on a builder for GitKraken themes.
